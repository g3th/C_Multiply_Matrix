# Multiply 2x3 * 3x2 Matrices
# Dynamically allocate memory for structs and arrays

Simple exercise in memory management.

Dynamic allocation passing a pointer to a struct, changing the data in a function, and printing the result.

Multiply and print two differently sized matrices, one being 2x3, and another being 3x2.
